# Transcriptome response of Exophiala dermatitidis adapted to gamma radiation
E. dermatitidis WT and pks1- were subjected to LD99 doses of acute gamma radiation for 15 consecutive weeks to produce several independently adapted strains. Transcriptional changes of the evolved strains were compared to the unevolved strains under irradiated and non-irradiated conditions.
